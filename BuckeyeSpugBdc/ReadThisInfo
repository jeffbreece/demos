Notes from the session:

	If using server side code then create a proxy class following this MSDN article.
	“SharePoint: Retrieving Credentials from the Secure Store Application using C#,” Matthew Yarlett

	Remember SPD has limitations but it's a good tool when your O365 job does not include BCS Meta Man by Lightning Tools.
	BCS Meta Man: http://lightningtools.com/products/bcs-meta-man-2010-and-2013/

	Using External Content Types as External Lists is fantastic with JavaScript work for SharePoint hosted apps using the standard REST List Web services in SharePoint.

	Always create a Limit Filter.

	Always use well structured DAL classes with Primary Keys when creating these BDC data models in SharePoint... otherwise it won't work. (AS400 lessons learned there).
